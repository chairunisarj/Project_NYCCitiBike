# Project_NYCCitiBike

Through this project, I train myself to do preparation for the data before doing the analysis.

Acknowledgments -

I get the data from here https://www.kaggle.com/akkithetechie/new-york-city-bike-share-dataset and get the explanation of the data format from the  https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data .

This dataset is the property of NYC Bike Share, LLC and Jersey City Bike Share, LLC (“Bikeshare”) operates New York City’s Citi Bike bicycle sharing service for T&C click https://ride.citibikenyc.com/data-sharing-policy .

When I was working for this project, I just know several basic of SQL.
It really took me back and forth to study the dataset and get the idea of it.
It also took a lot of browser tabs to find which syntax will do the job and what I have to do for doing the EDA.
So this is one of my baby step..
